---@diagnostic disable: deprecated
---Paint library for GMod!
---
---Purpose: drop in replacement to all surface/draw functions. Now there's no need to use them
---
---	Features:
---
---		1) Enchanced lines, with support of linear gradients.
---
---		2) Enchanced rounded boxes. They support stencils, materials and outlines.
---
---		3) Circles. Super fast.
---
--- 	4) Batching. Everything here can be batched to save draw calls. Saves a lot of performance.
---
--- 	5) This library is SUPER fast. Some functions here are faster than default ones.
---
--- 	6) Rectangle support, with support of per-corner gradienting
---
--- 	7) Coordinates do not end up being rounded. Good for markers and other stuff.
